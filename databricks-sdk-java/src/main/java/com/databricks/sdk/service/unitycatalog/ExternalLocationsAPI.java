/**
 * An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with a
 * storage credential that authorizes access to the cloud storage path. Each
 * external location is subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that
 * control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does not
 * have access to an external location in Unity Catalog, the request fails and
 * Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the
 * userâ€™s behalf.
 * 
 * Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
 * credentials directly.
 * 
 * To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user with
 * the **CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.
