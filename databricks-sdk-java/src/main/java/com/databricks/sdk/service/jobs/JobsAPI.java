/**
 * The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs.
 * 
 * You can use a Databricks job to run a data processing or data analysis task
 * in a Databricks cluster with scalable resources. Your job can consist of a
 * single task or can be a large, multi-task workflow with complex dependencies.
 * Databricks manages the task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring,
 * and error reporting for all of your jobs. You can run your jobs immediately
 * or periodically through an easy-to-use scheduling system. You can implement
 * job tasks using notebooks, JARS, Delta Live Tables pipelines, or Python,
 * Scala, Spark submit, and Java applications.
 * 
 * You should never hard code secrets or store them in plain text. Use the
 * :service:secrets to manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI]. Use the [Secrets
 * utility] to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs.
 *
