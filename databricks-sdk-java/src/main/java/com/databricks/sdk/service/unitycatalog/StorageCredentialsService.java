/**
 * A storage credential represents an authentication and authorization mechanism
 * for accessing data stored on your cloud tenant, using an IAM role. Each
 * storage credential is subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that
 * control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does not
 * have access to a storage credential in Unity Catalog, the request fails and
 * Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the
 * userâ€™s behalf.
 * 
 * Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
 * credentials directly.
 * 
 * To create storage credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin. The
 * account admin who creates the storage credential can delegate ownership to
 * another user or group to manage permissions on it.
 *
 * This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
